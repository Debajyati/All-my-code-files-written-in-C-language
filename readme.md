#  C Programming
 All of my important code files written in 'C' Language 
 ## The list of my programs are :-
 1.  A Guessing Game in C language.
 2.  Write a C program that converts numbers between decimal and binary representations.
 3.  Check if a number is even or odd using Booleans. 
 4.  Write a C -Program to check if a number is Even or odd.
 5. Write a C -Program to determine the nth term in the fibonacci sequence.
 6. Reverse the digits of a number.
 7.  Write a program to convert numbers between decimal and binary representations, including decimal integers to binary, decimal floats to binary, and binary to decimal integers, ensuring accurate conversions and proper memory management.
 8.  Print the digit count array from given inputs(the output array i.e. {1, no. of 1 digit numbers,2,no. of 2 digit numbers,so on...}).
 
 9.  Find the range between which a number exists as per user's input.4

 10.  Write a C -Program to check if a year is leap year or not.
 11.  Take a number as input and print it after left-shifting it by some number as per user's input.
 12. Write a program to determine whether a charcter entered by the user is lowercase or not.
 13.  Write a C -Program to determine the maximum of 3 numbers.

 14.  Write a program to print Multiplication Table of a given number n .

 15. Checking if a number is perfect number or not.

 16.  Write a C -Program to swap two numbers without a using 3rd Variable.
 
 17.  A C program to calculate the sum and average of integers of an array of variable size (memory allocation will be continued unless any input rather than integers is given from stdin).
