### After 1 year of C learning and practice I have written some more programs.
If you compare these files with the files in the `C-program-files-noob` folder, you will see how much my knowledge evolved. Because I was basically just a noob back at starting.
### Until now this folder contains 6 programs - 
Don't ask me what does the different program files do. The filenames say it all.
